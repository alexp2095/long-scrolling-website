     <h2>The Race of a Lifetime</h2>
     <p>The reason as to why I decided on this idea was because I love running and I have been doing it for years now. However, I actally was not always into runninng until
       my parents gave me running shoes in 2012. That day after, I ran and ran until I couldn't run anymore. Now, I participate in various running races, allowing me to further
       develop my skills. It has now become not just an activity, but a lifetime opportunity for me to change myself for the better I decided to title it The Race of a Lifetime
       simply because it accurately fitted how I feel about running and completing races. Since I was the only one who created the website and idea, I would be the sole author.</p>
